		<p>
			Daniel Craig is the latest James Bond actor and added a new dimension in the past 4 movies. His characterization added a layer of
			vulnerability and we see some of Bond's personality flaws come to life. This makes his character more believable and relatable
			than as before. Craig is probably the least likely actors to play as James Bond- before taking the role, he had long hair and
			objected to performing as a Type-A secret agent personality. There has been debate over whether or not Craig will be in the
			next Bond film, slotted to be released in 2020.
