		<p>
			Pierce Brosnan filled in a James Bond during a 6 year break between Bond films. He gave the series and much needed boost to get back into the marketplace.
			Goldeneye is one of the most popular James Bond movies,but Brosnan has some tough critics for his role as Bond in later films.
			Unfortunetly, Brosnan has too many grey hairs to be playing James Bond these days.
