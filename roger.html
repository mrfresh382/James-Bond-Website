	<div class="overview">
		<p>
			Sir Roger Moore is probably the most "British" of all the James Bond actors and perhaps the most qualified, due to his service in
				actual Military Intelligence in the British Army. Moore is also the only knighted James Bond actor. He is also the only deceased
				James Bond actor. His characterization most matches Sean Connery than all of the other Bond actors.
