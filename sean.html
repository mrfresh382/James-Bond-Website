		<p>
			Connery is the first James Bond Actor and is favored by many James Bond fan. Sean plays James Bond in an unofficial film Never Say Never Again in 1983
			which plotline is very similar to the earlier Thunderball movie. Why?  I don't know. Sean sets the stage for the remaining James Bond actors to aspire to. His voice is the
			most unique out of all the actors. Sean has been absent from the filmmaking industry for several years.
